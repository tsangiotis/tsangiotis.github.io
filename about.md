My name is Tasos Sangiotis. I recon you already know that since you are here. I build robots and I'm always right.

I am an electrical engineer and [photographer](https://tsangiotis.com/photography) situated in Athens, Greece.

This corner of the web is a collection of posts, essays and photos. They are mainly about photography, travel and occasionally technical stuff. Just navigate and you can find some easter eggs (which is French for pages I forgot they existed).

For my photography I shoot mostly candid street photos. See for your self [on Instagram](https://instagram.com/tsangiotis).

I work for [Arpedon](https://www.arpedon.com), an industrial engineering company.

If you choose to wander this wasteland do so with caution. Consider this your final warning.

To contact me use [tasos@hey.com](mailto:tasos@hey.com).

Have fun!
