I am an engineer situated in Athens, Greece who likes to take [photos](https://tsangiotis.com/photography).

This corner of the web is a collection of posts, essays and photos. They are mainly about photography, travel and occasionally technical stuff. Just navigate and you can find some easter eggs (which is French for pages I forgot they existed).

For my photography I shoot mostly candid street photos. See for your self [on Instagram](https://instagram.com/tsangiotis).

I work for [Arpedon](https://www.arpedon.com), an industrial engineering company.

if you want to email me just use [tsangiotis@gmail.com](mailto:tsangiotis@gmail.com).

Have fun!
