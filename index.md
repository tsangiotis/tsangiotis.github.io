Hello! My name is Tasos.

I work at [Arpedon](https://www.arpedon.com), an engineering company.

This website is a collection of posts, essays and photos. They are mainly about travel, food and occasionally technical stuff.

Occasionally I shoot [photos]({{ site.baseurl }}/photography). They are mostly [on Instagram](https://instagram.com/tsangiotis).

If you choose to wander this wasteland do so with caution. Consider this your final warning.

To contact me use [tasos@hey.com](mailto:tasos@hey.com).
