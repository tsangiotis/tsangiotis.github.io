This book is good in the sense that it shows you some behavior's that you would believe as impossible to work actually working.

In my opinion in some cases it pushes it but I am yet to try all the tricks.

Count of this book to make you more daring in actually trying. 

Since I read it I am more aware on my flaws on verbal communication every day and conscious. 

Be sure to practice. Old habits die hard.
