From [Wikipedia](https:///en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Freeman):

> Mr. Freeman is a Russian animated web series named after its main character. The series appeared on YouTube on September 21, 2009 and got considerable popularity in Runet. The main content of the series is monologues which in a harsh manner criticize the lifestyle of modern everyman. As of August 16, 2012 there are 19 episodes published. The total number of views is more than 35 million.

I discovered Mr. Freeman by [this](https:///www.youtube.com/watch?v=n90cZxLxrSo) video last year which I saved on my Favourites list on Youtube.
Today as I was cleaning up this list, I rediscovered it and felt like sharing.

You may say you are not that guy for whom he is talking about but chances are you have a lot in common. Agreeing or not with him and his opinion of you there is sure some food for thought in his words.
