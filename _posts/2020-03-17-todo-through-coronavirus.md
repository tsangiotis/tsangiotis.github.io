One of the terrors of staying home for the coronavirus is the lack of outside leisure time. 

You may work remotely by day but when the night comes you need something to accompany that whisky, wine or beer glass. Don't need to mention that any other alcoholic drink is unacceptable.

With that in mind present the following books and movies, optimized for well... staying inside now you have all the time in the world to get your reading done.

<p>You will miss airplanes and travel for a bit. Everyone's favorite part of the trip.</p>

<p>The antidote is the thrilling story behind "the Queen of the Skies" the <em>Boeing 747</em> as told by Joe Sutter, one of the most celebrated engineers of the twentieth century, who spearheaded its design and construction.</p>

<p>Almost everything about the 747 were unprecedented and his team were not the most star spangled awesome people at Boeing. Those were chasing the supersonic dream. Guess who stands today at airports watching the plane <strong>they</strong> designed to take off and land countless times everyday.</p>

<p>If you are a maker, an aviation enthusiast or you like stories that leave a mark, there is a book for you.</p>

<p>This book I read in a day.</p>

<p>It is the story of a woman's descent into devastating emptiness and madness after being abandoned by her husband with two young children to care for. She feels trapped like you do those days. It is a fitting book.</p>

<p>Also there is a conspiracy involving the author of the book. Elena Ferrante is a pseudonym. Googling will help you pass the time</p>

<p>The collapse of society is not upon us but the situation draws similarities.</p>

<p>In this big fat book that can get you through the pandemic, Ayn Rand tries to communicate her theory of Objectivism. It expresses the advocacy of reason, individualism, and capitalism, and depicts what Rand saw to be the failures of governmental coercion.</p>

<p>You will have pretty strong opinions about her be it positive or negative. One of those of course but maybe. Either case you will not regret reading the book.</p>

<p>There is a 3 part movie based on this book. Complete garbage. Don't even try.</p>

<p>This is a contender for your favorite book price.</p>

<p>The devil meddles with mortals and performs magic tricks, a love story gets told in a psych ward, witches, Jesus and Pilatus have weird conversations.</p>

<p>Some people think of this as the best Rusian novel of the 20th century.</p>

<p>There are even <a href="http://cr.middlebury.edu/public/russian/Bulgakov/public_html/">supporting guides</a> for this book.</p>

## Movies

I will not get into the details. Don't want to spoil anything.

### No country for old men – 2007

![No Country for Old Men](images/{{ page.slug }}/no_country_for_old_men.jpg)

The best movie yet from the Coen brothers.

### True Grit – 2010

Ultimate action, romance and revenge.

### Moonlight – 2016

![Moonlight](images/{{ page.slug }}/moonlight.jpg)

This movie from the list I haven't seen. I really want to see this. But I can vouch for it. I made the Pollo a la Plancha from the movie and it was delicious.
