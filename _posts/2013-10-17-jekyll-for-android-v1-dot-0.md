After a couple of months around [this](http://github.com/tsagi/jekyllforandroid) project it reached

a stage where maybe it is not super stable but it is usable and pretty ok for my needs.

It provides:

*   UI that is simple and I like.
*   Ability to commit a new post through Github API.
*   Keeps a draft.
*   A list of the user's posts.
*   Ability to edit previous posts.

Here are some screenshots:

The source code is available and always will be [on Github](https://github.com/tsagi/jekyll-client-for-android).
I think about publishing the app on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) for a small
price (let's a dollar or two) mainly to get back the money from that Developer account.

What you will get is easy updates through the Play Store and the happiness of buying me a beer.

You can download the latest binary [here](https://github.com/tsagi/jekyll-client-for-android/blob/master/README.md#download).

What do you think about it?

Let me know! :)
