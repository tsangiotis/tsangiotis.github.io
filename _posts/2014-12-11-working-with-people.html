<div class="posthaven-post-body">
<p>The world nowadays works in teams and as you may know I’ ve been involved in many teams around this time.</p>
<p>This team can be a startup, a group, a hackerspace or even you and your friends.<br />
When some people do something together they are a team. And a good team acts like a good piece of machinery.</p>
<p>Working in teams is hard but also very efficient.<br />
If a team is managed correctly, many extraordinary things can be done.</p>
<p>This is what I’ve understood about being in teams and learning from my mistakes and others’.</p>
<h2>Score the Goal fast</h2>
<p>I am not a football fan by any means but it is pretty straightforward that your sole concern is to put the ball behind the line.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter if you do it from the centre of the stadium with the most cinematic way or you do it with a simple boring move.</p>
<p>Either way you get <strong><em>one point</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t over-thing about the best way to do something. It results almost always to a lot of talking and less doing.</p>
<h3>Just do it!</h3>
<h2>Temporary does not exist</h2>
<p>Give final solutions. Not placeholders.</p>
<p>When you need to make a choice, never reschedule it with a wrong response. You will forget about it and learn to live with it.</p>
<p>So make every decision count by choosing the best solution at the time. You can always fine-tune later.</p>
<h2>Stay motivated</h2>
<p>Being in a team can be exhausting but when you accomplish stuff, this does not matter.</p>
<p>However it is very common to get stuck. Your hands are tied and you can’t move.<br />
When in this position don’t panic but do something to get cracking.</p>
<p>For as long you stay frozen, your team develops tension and if it reaches critical tension points often or stays on them for a long time, it might break.</p>
<p>When machines are static they rust and break.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://finette.com/">Pascal Finette</a> says, <strong><a href="http://theheretic.me/2014/12/04/always-run-never-walk/">Always run. Never walk</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Be precise and push when needed</h2>
<p>You have to be clear and precise to others. Give them all the info that is needed and also demand it.</p>
<p>Also when the job at hand must finish, don’t wait for the others. Do the most you can and push them to do their part.</p>
<h2>Log everything</h2>
<p>There should be a log of the team and things should not rely on memory.</p>
<p>Write down what happens when it happens and when the time comes you will be glad you did.</p>
<h2>But be bold but straight</h2>
<p>You cannot afford to keep things inside. <a href="http://tsagi.me/listen-to-people">Listen to people</a> and they will listen to you.</p>
<p>When you find that you don’t agree with something, tell it to the other’s face with care, not with grudge.</p>
<p>One can get defensive or better. If you do it the right way and everyone keeps an open mind, most of the times you will hit the second case.</p>
<h2>Value human relations</h2>
<p>Many times we tend to forget that our teammates most of the times are also friends.</p>
<p>More often we forget about friends and people outside of the team. They are the ones who support you and you are the one who supports them.</p>
<p>Remember to have time for everyone. Most of all remember to have time for new connections.</p>
<p>That’s the only way you will meet more and more amazing people.</p>
<h2>Be positive</h2>
<p>Hard times will come but also happy ones that make up for everything.</p>
<p>Solve your problems quickly and don’t blame others.</p>
<p>The thing you do best is to solve problems.<br />
Put it in use for the things you <strong>can</strong> do something and don’t bother with things you <strong>can’ t</strong> do something about.</p>
<p>Hope I was of help. You can speak your mind in the comments! :)</p>
