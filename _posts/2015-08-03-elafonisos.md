# Simos beach

Simos is a the biggest beach in Elafonisos. It consists of Big Simos and Small Simos. There is sand everywhere and the water is mesmerising.

The name of the beach is due to the of the drowning of the sponge diver Simos from Kalymnos in the area where the Small Simos beach is now.

# The sun goes down

Islands of Madonna (Nisia tis Panagias) is a beach and a restaurant on a high spot of the island. From there you can have a great view of the beach and the sunset.

# Resulted to Moon rising

The moon was almost full and with the help of some beer, a good lens and a tripod I almost saw Neil Armstrongâ€™s flag.

# The Port

The town and port of Elafonisos is a typical one. Except the small rock where the small church of Saint Spyridonas is located. Saint Spyridonas is considered the protector of the island and the small rock is the most beautiful part of the port.
