-   [Belt-Drives - General](http://www.vibrationschool.com/mans/SpecInter/SpecInter15c.htm)  Aug 30, 2022\
    *Belt-drive problems, which include shaft misalignment, pulley misalignment, belt wear, belt resonance, belts too tight, belts too loose, pulley eccentricity and bent shafts, can be relatively straight forward to detect but can be far more difficult to specifically diagnose and correct. That is mainly due to the wide variety of problems that can occur in the installation and assembling of the belt drive, the difficulty of doing field testing on belts and the possibility of other influences (i.e. the base) having some effect. *

As for the personal site it is back to Jekyll. I played with [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev/) for a while but it became a lot like Jekyll recently so I might as well embrace the path fully.
