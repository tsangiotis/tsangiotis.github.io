I’ve been in a mode of getting more stable and reliable in the last months but when I saw this 3 or 4 days ago, it was like the random thoughts in my head strengthen and got in order. I try to avoid the _emergency brake_ in any situation. Of course it fails some times but the rest of them are very satisfying.
