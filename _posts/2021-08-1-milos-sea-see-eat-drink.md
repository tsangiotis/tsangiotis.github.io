While in love or alone, Milos is a place to enjoy the sand and sun. Bellow are some musts from my visit. I will not bore you with the unpleasant or meh experiences. Only with the great and there were many.

## Sea

First order of business about a week before your trip, book a boat toor. Before you book watch the weather for the best possible date in terms of wind. meteo.gr is a great site for that.

The trip we took was with [Volcano boat](https://volcanoboat.eu/) and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. You spend a lot of time at unreachable by car beaches and they get you local treats between stops. During the end you do snorkeling at Kleftiko with the help of experienced divers.

Beyond that, regarding the beaches you will visit every day, I really liked Paleochori (visited twice). The sand is hot, the water cold and if you have a mask you will enjoy the underwater landscapes.

Second in my ranking comes Agia Kyriaki. The beach bar is good, and the water perfect.

Must swims include Alogomantra and Fyropotamos.

![Fyropotamos beach](/images/{{ page.slug }}/99bdae11-d3da-4dd6-8f5d-2bd422b5f4e3.jpeg)

After that do what you want. The island has 90+ beaches, you’ll never catch them all in a way that’s worth it.

## See

You must be wandering where is Sarakiniko in the above list.

Sarakiniko is to see but not to waste a swim on. You can spend a couple of hours there exploring and taking pictures.

Another place you should see is Klima. This location hosted the homes of many fishermen. The doors are colored because the fishermen needed to spot their home from afar and with the help of wires get them inside to protect them. Must visit at sundown.

The last sunset to schedule is at the top of the Castle at Plaka. The view is amazing.

We had the luck to visit while a storm was taking place at the distance.

## Eat

Bariello is the best place for creative Greek cuisine. As a renounced critic I ranked it with 9/10. Takis is an exemplary host.

While in Plaka, visit Palaio for traditional deserts. Orange pie and Galaktompoureko are verified by me.

_This section omits pictures as the food got eaten as it hit the table._

## Drink

There are very few places. Verina Cocktail Bar at Plaka is the best.
