<div class="posthaven-post-body">
<p>If you follow the web for the last two weeks you probably know about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data">that little (ugly) leaked PowerPoint</a> that explains a NSA program called PRISM.</p>
<p>It was a guy named Edward Snowden that found out and left a job that provided a great income at the NSA because he didn't wanted to be part of this.</p>
<p>Here is an interview at the Guardian.</p>
<p>Whether we believe his motives or not, PRISM exists more than 5 years now.</p>
<div id="posthaven_gallery[769388]" class="posthaven-gallery">
<p class="posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed"><img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1-2.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>You can see that most of the streams we use today, even our operating systems and our email providers feed data to NSA.</p>
<p>If someone gets tagged even by mistake, the NSA can search to his past without a judge order or any control.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about PRISM just search the web.</p>
<p>My concern was If I can protect my self. My first thought was to leave Social Media completely. After that, dump google and start using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for my online searches, dump Gmail and find a service that PRISM has no effect on and dump my Mac OS X for my <a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> partition and even switch that to <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.</p>
<p>VPN and tunnelling is not very efficient so I wouldn't do that:P</p>
<p>But even if I do all these, I am not safe. Because not everyone I communicate does that and the servers we use for all these get tracked (HTTPS is only a partial measure) and while services get added to the PRISM trunk the internet becomes smaller.</p>
<p>Most of us got nothing to hide. But we don't want to get checked every time we send a mail.</p>

</div>
<p>Should we get used to it?</p>
