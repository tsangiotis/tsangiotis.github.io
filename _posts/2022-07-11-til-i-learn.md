Recently I stumbled upon [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)'s of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) fame [TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/) project.

It is a public scratchpad of sorts and I like the idea. That guy scratches a lot though.

I bookmark all kinds of stuff without really getting back to it and take notes on many places. Some notes though and especially those for programming reference I want to go back to and even have some examples attached.

Those notes I want to make into little posts tagged [#til](https://tsangiotis.com/blog/?q=til).

[On my site](https://tsangiotis.com/) along with the vast amount of prose you will find those snippets. To get you started, here is the latest additions:

[Simple django search](https://tsangiotis.com/simple-django-search/)\
For the last couple of years, whatever decomposing has happend on [Mechbase](https://arpedon.com/en/products/mechbase/) has happened through Turbo.

[Simpler search using Turbo Frames](https://tsangiotis.com/simpler-search-using-turbo-frames/)

Ok, I needed two search results

[Python instance check](https://tsangiotis.com/python-is-number/)\
Ones and Zeros get messy on dynamically typed languages. Crash that if statement.\
[Setting a variable default datetime value in Django/python](https://tsangiotis.com/default-datetime-value/)

Beware, when you reach this problem, your actual problem is elsewhere.

That's it for today. If you have any notes of your own let me know so I can steal them.

Until next time.
