Google’s project Soli is the future of wearable interaction.

Project Soli is basically a miniaturised radar implementation of the LEAP Motion sensor.

It can track precise finger gestures and at the same time is very compact as there is no combination of cameras and IR sensors.

As you see there is no much of implementation. The team has only raw data support for now but they say soon the sensor will be at the hands of the developers.

The most profound application is wearables. And the hot wearable right now is the smartwatch.

On a regular watch you don’t fondle the screen all the time and the crown is not intended to be used more than twice a year. Also it shouldn’t matter if you wear gloves. So a new interface should arise that is capable of satisfying smartwatches requirements. I believe that this will be Soli (or something like it).

Until two days ago, I was waiting for smartwatches to become less bulky but now I am waiting for manufacturers to incorporate Soli too.
