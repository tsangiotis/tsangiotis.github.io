Joshua and Ryan are very successful entrepreneurs and a very clever hack. They have sold more than 4 million copies of their book according to their also successful [website](http://www.theminimalists.com) and the documentary that is the center of this article has had great reception since December when it was released. Getting back to their website, there is a services section with everything from writing tutoring to life, dating and business coaching. Who is now the actual customer of Joshua and Ryan? I really don't know but it is itching me to talk about the industry they belong in rather than decimate that duo with whom I have no issue whatsoever except from the fact that they are full of crap.

It is the notoriously blooming industry of happiness and success. The main customer of the happiness industry is the middle-class, educated consumer and fairly recently the corporate wallet[^2]. People know that this cow can be milked a lot as everyone wants to be happy and happiness is not quantifiable. It really is a perfect product.

In the 1950s and 60s, Abraham Maslow "proclaimed the supremacy of the self-actualizing person, who realizes the fullness of his or her nature – without doing harm to others, of course – and lives as happily as one can on earth," notes Algis Valiunas. Among the more modern offerings, Tony Robbins has raked in $80 million in a year and John Gray’s New York Times best-seller *Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus*" outsold almost every other book in the known universe except the Bible" claims Valiunas in The New Atlantis. In his particularly eloquent and scathing commentary, "The Science of Self-Help," Valiunas points out that "this is the scientific fruit of those who consider themselves not only the wisest of our time but evidently the wisest of all time," with teaching that is "sensible, unexceptional. It is also obvious and insipid. Accept imperfection and pain. Do some jogging. Slow down and count your breaths."[^3]

If it was just business and there are people who want to be tricked into thinking that life is binary in the terms of happiness vs. unhappiness that's fine. But it turns out that this is dangerous. You see all this is not about what you do or what you think, but about how you *feel*. And since how you feel can’t be argued against, it is conveniently insulated from all debate. Men and women can now stroll around in continuous self-monitoring mode, using apps to track their changes of mood and rate their state of being. These wrong ratings more often than not create false models which lead to disappointment and eventually to depression.

And if individual narcissistic behavior was not enough imagine companies using happiness as a management tool. Google has a ["Jolly Good Fellow"](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-jolly-good-fellow-chade-meng-tan-2015-9) (actual job description) to keep the company’s spirits up. Zappos, an online shoe shop expects its staff to be in a state of barely controlled delirium when they sell shoes. Zappos is so happy with its work on joy that it has spun off a consultancy called Delivering Happiness. It has a chief happiness officer (CHO), a global happiness navigator, a happiness hustler, a happiness alchemist and, for philosophically minded customers, a happiness owl.

Some firms are trying to create some wellbeing, too, showering their employees with mindfulness courses, yoga lessons and anything else that proves that managers are interested in "the whole person". Only happy fools would take that at face value. Management theorists note that a big threat to corporate performance is widespread [disengagement among workers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2013/09/02/why-are-70-of-employees-disengaged-and-what-can-you-do-about-it/#473120ee5649). Happy people are more engaged and productive, say psychologists. Gallup claimed in 2013 that the "unhappiness" of employees costs the American economy $500 billion a year in lost productivity[^4]. However it should be an indicator of  false practices that the figure has not shifted a dollar in 3 years according to  he latest Gallup [report](http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx) on the matter.

If you thought that this is just a private sector niche, Several governments, including those of America, Britain, France and Australia, now publish for the benefit of their citizens regular reports on levels of national well-being. Bhutan has long measured its gross national happiness, and the United Arab Emirates boasts a brand-new [Ministry of Happiness](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/cabinet-members/her-excellency-ohoud-bint-khalfan-al-roumi).

As stated above, the problem with tracking happiness is that it is such a vague metric: it is difficult to prove or disprove numbers since it is not entirely clear what is being measured. Companies would be much better off forgetting wishy-washy goals like encouraging contentment. They should concentrate on eliminating specific annoyances, such as time-wasting meetings and pointless memos. Instead, like every organization who cannot imagine there is something wrong with it's default practices, they are likely to develop ever more sophisticated ways of measuring the emotional state of their employees. Academics are already busy creating smartphone apps that help people keep track of their moods, such as [Track Your Happiness](https://www.trackyourhappiness.org) and [Moodscope](https://www.moodscope.com). 

This cult of happiness is dangerous both to individuals and companies. Life is full of different experiences and tedious processes and you should expect unhappiness to creep in from time to time. You cannot hack happiness by throwing away all your stuff and you sure as hell cannot increase profits by invading the individual liberty of your employees with forced behaviors. And you probably don't want to. Companies have a right to ask their employees to be polite when they deal with members of the public. They do not have a right to try to regulate their workers' psychological states and turn happiness into an  instrument of corporate control.
