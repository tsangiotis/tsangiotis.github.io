Yeah

## Disconnect but shit to do

once you start conceiving of your online social world as countable, itâ€™s hard, as many, many people have noted, not to make decisions based on what will boost those numbers.

## Why I need a *dumb* phone

- Distraction
- Facebook/Twitter/Instagram
- Reading articles/Websurf like crazy
- Email
- YouTube

## Why I need a *smart* phone

- Calendar - by far the most important app
- Contacts - imidiate contact sync
- Facebook Messenger - Friends are not willing to spend their finite amount of SMS texting me and many of them live in other countries - Very frustrated with my messaging sittuation.
- Notes
- Money tracking app
- GPS Navigation - I need to be places
- Spotify - FM radio is not an option
- Camera - MARIA 2 is a fairly big lady to bring on a night out

As you see a whole lot of pretty well functioning systems to be replaced by another kind of system.

I am a big fan of pen and paper but I have a policy against things that are inconvenient and prone to getting destroyed easily.
 
It's a Moleskine, naturally, since I'm a lemming-hipster that believes my choice of notebook will direct me toward the path of Hemingway and Picasso, not just to the Bedford Ave. L stop in Williamsburg. I haven't named the notebook out loud, but if it's possible to mentally "name" something the abstract concept of a color, that's what I call it: it is orange.
