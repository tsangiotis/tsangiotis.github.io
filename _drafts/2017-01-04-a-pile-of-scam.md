Some time ago I got that email.

>**FROM:** Francisco May<br>
>**TO:** Me<br>
>**SUBJECT:** Re: i await your urgent respond<br>

>Hi Tasos,
>
>Compliment of the day, am happy to hear from you again, I am Ms. May Ann Francisco, a staff of the PNB — Philippine National Bank — Pasay City. here in the Philippines. **I have a project for you, Is it confidential to discuss here? Well, my percentage is good for an offer but before I begin with you, are you comfortable being an international partner to a project?.**
>
>I will await for your response before I give you more vital details on this project. Your response to my email will be kept confidential.
>
>Regards,<br>
>Ms. May Ann Francisco

May Ann knows my name and somehow it’ s not our first dance. Probably this is a legit offer but it would be wise to investigate. I am intrigued so I respond.

>Hi there May,

>**Being an international partner to a project is a lifelong dream of mine. As long as it is legal I am all for it!**

>**Please tell me more and what I have to do. Note that I can’t visit Pasay City for now so all our communications must be done through here.**
>
>Best regards,<br>
>Tasos Sangiotis

Here I have to mention that May has quite the email ettique. You know the guy in the open-source project mailing list who manages to completely ignore the reply button? Despite my best efforts to make our communications resemble 21st century civilised human interaction, May insisted on branching out onto new email threads so I let her be.

She asked that her information will remain private so please if you know her don’t tell her about what I just did. Here is the next email I got on a new thread again.

>**FROM:** Francisco May<br>

>In 2011, the Subject matter; FI/PNB/952/051/0721 came to our Business Bank to engage in discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. **He informed us that he had a Financial Portfolio of $ 15,991,673 (USD) , which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.**<br>

>**There is $ 15,991,673 (Fifteen million, nine hundred and Ninety One Thousand, six hundred and Seventy three United States Dollars) deposited, I alone have the Deposit Details and they will Release the Deposit to no one unless I Instruct them to do so.** <br>
>…
>
>**My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation / associate, and all etiquette shall be done in accordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the common law, the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the law. There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from being so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of theirs acceptance; perfect operation whereby the paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole beneficiary is confirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you, that is, I will simply nominate you as the Next of Kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 60/40.**

>I am happily married with a kid, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I shall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed, we’ll plan a meeting.

>I await your response.

>Yours Sincerely,<br>
>Ms. May Ann Francisco<br>

As you notice, this is a one time oportunity. How can this be a scam email?Why did this even crossed my mind? Also I always wanted to have a remote relative.

To be fair I drew some insparation from Jame’s Veitch spam email series. I am not THAT original but I recon I fared ok for a one time thing. In most emails I thought I got too far with my excitement (see the rick rolling in the previous email) but you either do something all in or don’t do it at all. 

May sure did it all in because these emails are huge. I probably have not read the big ones in full.

I will need you to follow my instruction to enable us have this transaction completed on time.<br>

The last part with the no traveling policy got me a little sad but not so much that I couldn’t reply:

>**FROM:** Me<br>

>**SUBJECT:** Re: Await your quick response /More info<br>

>Don’t worry, this is not my first rodeo Ann May Donna Francisco (i like your middle name, do you watch Suits?). I am fully committed and ready to make this to the end.

>I would like to celebrate this collaboration by meeting you and the attorney in person after all is finished. I always wanted to visit Hong Kong, so let’s do it there in 16 days when the transaction will be over and the three of us will be richer.

>Also can we get clear about the percentages?
>
>is it 60% for me and 40% for you with the attorney getting nothing or is it the other way around?

>P.S. what do you think about the name change idea?

>Yours,<br>
>Tasos

At this point I knew that she can go with whatever I go. I think she punishes me with longform email and branching threads but this is so worth it.

>**FROM:** Francisco May<br>
>**TO:** Me<br>
>**SUBJECT:** Re: Await your quick response /More info<br>
>
>Dear Tasos,
>
>Thank you once again for your genuine interest in this transaction, I am very glad to note that you are a noble, matured, and trustworthy person whom I can rely on for your capabilities to handle this transaction, and for a person of your status and experience I am very confident doing this business with you.<br>
>…

>Having resolved to entrust this transaction into your hands, I want to remind you that it needs your commitment and diligent follow up. If you work seriously in a couple of days the entire transaction should be over.<br>
>…

>Firstly, I will want to know precisely the type of occupation that you do, you should note that this project is highly capital intensive, this is why I have to be very careful, I need your total devotion and trust to see this through, I know we have not met before but I am very confident that we will be able to establish the necessary trust that we need to execute this project.

>I am now in a search of a foreign on-line bank which I may require that you open an account in your name in this foreign bank, I will find a bank that you can open account on-line with request your fiscal present. The money would be transferred to your account which you will open in this bank for both of us, this is one of the ways I have found, and it will protect us from my local banks in my country, I want us to enjoy this money in peace when we conclude, so you should listen to my instructions and follow them religiously. Also you have to know that I cannot transfer this money in my name as my bank will be aware that it is from me, this is where I need you.
>
>As result of this you may have to open an account in the corresponding bank that has the same transfer telex type with my bank, I will obtain a certificate of deposit from my bank, it will be issued in your name, and this will make you the beneficiary of the funds. After the money is been release it will be transfer to your account for both of us and we can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective home bank accounts bit by bit, I will also perfect the documentations with the assistance of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right.
>
>Before we commence all this things, I will need to do the paper work that will place you as the beneficiary of the fund, so I will need you to send me a copy of your identification (Any identity card OR International passport OR Driver’s License), your current residential address and your phone number, I will give them to the attorney who will do the paper work and it will also prove me that I am transacting with the correct person and as soon as I get these from you I will commence the paper work that will place you as the beneficiary. I hope you will understand why I need all these, the money in question is big and I want to ensure that I know you well before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the project, I will also send you my own Identification upon the receipt of your identification.
>
>Ensure that you keep this project confidential; do not discuss it with anybody, because of the confidential nature of this transaction and my work.
>
>Note: Use your real legal name, the paperwork will makes it legal. 60% for my end while 40% for you. Don’t worry, I will take care of the attorney.
