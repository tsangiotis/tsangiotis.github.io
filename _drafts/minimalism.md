Ok, I saw that fancy film called [Minimalism: A Documentary About The Important Things](https://minimalismfilm.com). The film takes us through the lives of two regular bros, Joshua & Ryan who decided that they can live lives with only the necessary stuff. No excessive consumerism and no distractions. They tell us how good it feels, how liberating and how profoundly peaceful that is. The southing music and the big enough for some relaxing shots pauses help with that and if one things about it they have some points. The issue is the delivery of those points.

Just looking at the title, one might rush to the conclusion that this is some new hipster mumbo jumbo. And he would be right except for the "new" part. The most dated example I know, of a civilized someone who willingly lived that way is Henry David Thoreau. He is mostly known for an experiment in minimal living he conducted at Walden Pond which is a lake in Concord, Massachusetts. In 1845, he built himself a small cabin, moved in, and spent two years living and writing about the experience in his book titled [*Walden*](http://thoreau.eserver.org/walden00.html). You are better off reading this as it is written vastly better than anything produced by the Minimalists. Also Thoreau is very quotable so you might accumulate some words to impress friends or better halves.

With some research I could find examples of earlier minimalists but I believe none of those would have the same dedication on documenting their experience as Thoreau. Also he's got a neckbeard going so you know where this is going.

Thoreau was from a wealthy family so he was able to spend his time writing without worrying about trivial stuff like money. However when his first book which he had published himself, turned out to be a failure he had to go to back to his father's pencil factory. That didn't work out very well so he focused on activities that let him be out in the woods like farm labor and surveying.

Thoreau was really ahead of his time. He wrote mostly about nature. A writing genre with no much meaning at the time. As a result to his friends and fellow writers, Thoreau was a disappointment, a talented writer who had chosen to squander his gifts walking around in camouflage so he could more easily sneak up on wild animals. He was also a pescatarian, a locavore, probably the first environmentalist, a do-it-yourselfer. He practiced yoga, read Hindu sacred texts, and was a bit of a food faddist.[^1] The paragon of hipster we would say today.

Just like Thoreau, Joshua and Ryan did not have any real problems. Possibly they even had some artistic aspirations. They state they had jobs in the corporate sector and made six figure salaries. However they felt miserable as their relationships were not so good and they felt trapped from their stuff and the distractions around them. So they ditched their jobs, sold their stuff and wrote a book about it.

The Minimalists, as they call themselves, strike some valid points. We buy stuff out of social pressure and we try to fit into social norms. But that behavior, which is natural by the way, will not make you happier. It's just a temporary rush of adrenalin. If you reduce all the stuff that introduce social and actual friction between you and life you will feel better. They even say that if something is of value to you, you don't have to get rid of it. Just get rid of the junk.

You would figure that this is common sense to everyone and fairly easy to communicate in the above paragraph. I have been criticized of making some aggressive summarizations though, so it is not a surprise that a 79 minute film is actually needed to explain the concept. It involves interviews with experts from various fields and successful minimalists. It gives us a backstage view to the book tour of Joshua and Ryan and a lot of examples of bad behaviors from black Friday to show us who we *really* are.

They top that with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7nMTUs4AHU) of a woman snatching a toaster from the hands of a kid. With their main customer being the educated middle-class what they do is make them feel like they are a step away from that behavior because they bought a new TV or something. Even if you get right all the points in the world, that is not ok.

Joshua and Ryan are very successful entrepreneurs and a very clever hack. They have sold more than 4 million copies of their book according to their also successful [website](http://www.theminimalists.com) and the documentary that is the center of this article has had great reception since December when it was released. Getting back to their website, there is a services section with everything from writing tutoring to life, dating and business coaching. Who is now the actual customer of Joshua and Ryan? I really don't know but it is itching me to talk about the industry they belong in rather than decimate that duo with whom I have no issue whatsoever except from the fact that they are full of crap.

It is the notoriously blooming industry of happiness and success. The main customer of the happiness industry is the middle-class, educated consumer and fairly recently the corporate wallet[^2]. People know that this cow can be milked a lot as everyone wants to be happy and happiness is not quantifiable. It really is a perfect product.

In the 1950s and 60s, Abraham Maslow "proclaimed the supremacy of the self-actualizing person, who realizes the fullness of his or her nature – without doing harm to others, of course – and lives as happily as one can on earth," notes Algis Valiunas. Among the more modern offerings, Tony Robbins has raked in $80 million in a year and John Gray’s New York Times best-seller *Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus*" outsold almost every other book in the known universe except the Bible" claims Valiunas in The New Atlantis. In his particularly eloquent and scathing commentary, "The Science of Self-Help," Valiunas points out that "this is the scientific fruit of those who consider themselves not only the wisest of our time but evidently the wisest of all time," with teaching that is "sensible, unexceptional. It is also obvious and insipid. Accept imperfection and pain. Do some jogging. Slow down and count your breaths."[^3]

If it was just business and there are people who want to be tricked into thinking that life is binary in the terms of happiness vs. unhappiness that's fine. But it turns out that this is dangerous. You see all this is not about what you do or what you think, but about how you *feel*. And since how you feel can’t be argued against, it is conveniently insulated from all debate. Men and women can now stroll around in continuous self-monitoring mode, using apps to track their changes of mood and rate their state of being. These wrong ratings more often than not create false models which lead to disappointment and eventually to depression.

And if individual narcissistic behavior was not enough imagine companies using happiness as a management tool. Google has a ["Jolly Good Fellow"](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-jolly-good-fellow-chade-meng-tan-2015-9) (actual job description) to keep the company’s spirits up. Zappos, an online shoe shop expects its staff to be in a state of barely controlled delirium when they sell shoes. Zappos is so happy with its work on joy that it has spun off a consultancy called Delivering Happiness. It has a chief happiness officer (CHO), a global happiness navigator, a happiness hustler, a happiness alchemist and, for philosophically minded customers, a happiness owl.

Some firms are trying to create some wellbeing, too, showering their employees with mindfulness courses, yoga lessons and anything else that proves that managers are interested in "the whole person". Only happy fools would take that at face value. Management theorists note that a big threat to corporate performance is widespread [disengagement among workers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymyler/2013/09/02/why-are-70-of-employees-disengaged-and-what-can-you-do-about-it/#473120ee5649). Happy people are more engaged and productive, say psychologists. Gallup claimed in 2013 that the "unhappiness" of employees costs the American economy $500 billion a year in lost productivity[^4]. However it should be an indicator of  false practices that the figure has not shifted a dollar in 3 years according to  he latest Gallup [report](http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx) on the matter.

If you thought that this is just a private sector niche, Several governments, including those of America, Britain, France and Australia, now publish for the benefit of their citizens regular reports on levels of national well-being. Bhutan has long measured its gross national happiness, and the United Arab Emirates boasts a brand-new [Ministry of Happiness](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/cabinet-members/her-excellency-ohoud-bint-khalfan-al-roumi).

As stated above, the problem with tracking happiness is that it is such a vague metric: it is difficult to prove or disprove numbers since it is not entirely clear what is being measured. Companies would be much better off forgetting wishy-washy goals like encouraging contentment. They should concentrate on eliminating specific annoyances, such as time-wasting meetings and pointless memos. Instead, like every organization who cannot imagine there is something wrong with it's default practices, they are likely to develop ever more sophisticated ways of measuring the emotional state of their employees. Academics are already busy creating smartphone apps that help people keep track of their moods, such as [Track Your Happiness](https://www.trackyourhappiness.org) and [Moodscope](https://www.moodscope.com). 

This cult of happiness is dangerous both to individuals and companies. Life is full of different experiences and tedious processes and you should expect unhappiness to creep in from time to time. You cannot hack happiness by throwing away all your stuff and you sure as hell cannot increase profits by invading the individual liberty of your employees with forced behaviors. And you probably don't want to. Companies have a right to ask their employees to be polite when they deal with members of the public. They do not have a right to try to regulate their workers' psychological states and turn happiness into an  instrument of corporate control.
