<h2>street photography</h2>
<p class="phonetics">/striːt/ /fəˈtɒɡrəfi/</p>

<p>This is a genre that every photographer will try at least once in their life. Its broad appeal stems from the fact that you can do it anywhere; there’s a human element to the images that captivate the viewer, and if done well, can make for some extremely arresting images. However, it also requires balls.</p>

<p>If you want to try it I have some words of advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't hide what you are doing</li>
<li>hide what you are doing</li>
<li>a smile goes a long way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>portraiture</h2>
<p class="phonetics">/ˈpɔːtrɪtʃə/</p>

<p>Art snobs say that a good portrait can capture the <i>"essence"</i> of the subject. Most mean it in a dull and boring way. My interpretation is the iconic Winston Churchill portrait by Yousuf Karsh. I like it because it seems genuine.</p>

<p>The artist describes the portrait:</p>

<p class="photoquote">“Churchill’s cigar was ever present. I held out an ashtray but he would not dispose of it. I went back to my camera and made sure that everything was all right technically. I waited; he continued to chomp vigorously at his cigar…Then I stepped toward him and, without premeditation, but ever so respectfully, I said, ‘Forgive me, sir,’ and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph…”</p>
