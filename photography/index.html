            <p>Like most places Athens at night is magical.</p>

            <p>Unlike most places Athens at night is extremely alive.</p>

            <p> Summer 2017, Patras, Greece</p>
            <p>As I went to grab some coffee I heard music from the main square. 
            With the camera in hand and some minutes to spare I rolled there and found hundreds of old people dancing. 
            They were super cool.</p>

            <p>This is a genre that every photographer will try at least once in their life. Its broad appeal stems from the fact that you can do it anywhere; there’s a human element to the images that captivate the viewer, and if done well, can make for some extremely arresting images. However, it also requires balls.</p>

            <p>If you want to try it I have some words of advice:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Don't hide what you are doing</li>
                <li>Hide what you are doing</li>
                <li>A smile goes a long way.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Art snobs say that a good portrait can capture the <i>"essence"</i> of the subject. 
            Most mean it in a dull and boring way. My interpretation is the iconic 
            <a style="" href="https://karsh.org/photographs/winston-churchill/">Winston Churchill portrait by Yousuf Karsh</a>. 
            I like it because it seems genuine.</p>

            <p>The artist describes the portrait:</p>

            <p class="photoquote">“Churchill’s cigar was ever present. I held out an ashtray but he would not dispose of it. I went back to my camera and made sure that everything was all right technically. I waited; he continued to chomp vigorously at his cigar…Then I stepped toward him and, without premeditation, but ever so respectfully, I said, ‘Forgive me, sir,’ and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph…”</p>
